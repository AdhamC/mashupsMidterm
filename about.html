        After entering a keyword, this webpage pulls news articles from the last month related to that keyword and then subsequently summarizes them before displaying the summaries. This allows the user to quickly take a look at the recent news regarding their topic of interest and allows them to open the full news articles if they wanted to dig deeper. I wanted the design of the webpage to be very simple, and flows simply top to down. The biggest challenge I faced was trying to get the summarization API to work. The one currently implemented is the third API I tried, and it is rate limited to 2 requests per second. The obvious next step would be to allow more than one keyword input.
